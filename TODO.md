Goal: Publish app as a SaaS product

Phase 1: Use product for self-use

- Add icons to budgets
- Allow split transactions between multiple budgets
- Allow linked transactions between multiple transactions
- Allow for account specification when uploading transactions
- Allow for multiple csv's to be uploaded at once
- Finalize UI pages (login, overview, budget, transactions)
- Create and connect database using Turso DB for personal use
- Create a single login to authenticate
- Add colors on the budget page
- Fix pie chart labels
- Allow creating rules for transactions to be automatically categorized
- Allow specifying a vendor for transactions
- Add encryption to data (local and database)
- Publish app on Netlify with Turso DB
- Parse PDF transactions and upload to database (or somehow get that data into the app)
- Make budget amounts roll over to the next month

Phase 2: Allow for users to create accounts

- Create landing page
- Create pricing page
- Create signup page
- Create login page
- Signup creates a new Turso DB database for the user
- Explain the budget system and how it works
- Get beta testers
- Get feedback on the app

Phase 3: Enhancements

- Allow scanning of receipts and uploading to database
- Allow for bank account connections and syncing of transactions
- Allow for manual transaction entry

Ideas:

- Allow pre-adding of transactions to the database and then automatically linking them when the transaction is uploaded
- Allow for automated categorization of transactions if no rules are met
